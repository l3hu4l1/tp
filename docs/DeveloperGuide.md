## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete support@adafruit.com`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class, as illustrated below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete support@adafruit.com")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete support@adafruit.com` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component

* stores vendor contact data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores inventory data i.e., all `Product` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueProductList` object).
* stores the current set of `Person`/`Product` objects as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`/`ObservableList<Product>`.
* stores alias data i.e., all `Alias` objects (which are contained in a `AliasList` object).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

**Archived records** are kept in the same data structures rather than moved to a separate list:
* A `Person` is considered archived when its tag set contains the reserved `"archived"` tag. `Person#archive()` / `Person#restore()` return new immutable copies with the tag added or removed.
* A `Product` carries a dedicated `boolean isArchived` field. `Product#archive()` / `Product#restore()` return new immutable copies with the flag toggled.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />

The `Storage` component
* saves contact, inventory, alias and user preference data in JSON format, and reads them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `InventoryStorage`, `AliasStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo and Redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedVendorVault`. It extends `VendorVault` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `vendorVaultStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

`VendorVault` is the main data structure that holds the current state of the address book and inventory data. If only the address book data is modified, the inventory data will still be saved in the `VendorVault` state. This allows us to have a single undo/redo mechanism for both address book and inventory data.

* `VersionedVendorVault#commit()` — Saves the current VendorVault state in its history.
* `VersionedVendorVault#undo()` — Restores the previous VendorVault state from its history.
* `VersionedVendorVault#redo()` — Restores a previously undone VendorVault state from its history.
* `VersionedVendorVault#canUndo()` and `VersionedVendorVault#canRedo()` — Checks if undo/redo operations are possible based on the current state of the history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitVendorVault()`, `Model#undoVendorVault()`, `Model#redoVendorVault()`, `Model#canUndoVendorVault` and `Model#canRedoVendorVault` respectively.

#### Usage Scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedVendorVault` will be initialized with the initial VendorVault (which includes the address book and inventory internally) state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single VendorVault state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete support@adafruit.com` command to delete the corresponding vendor contact in VendorVault. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitVendorVault()`, causing the modified state of the VendorVault after the `delete support@adafruit.com` command executes to be saved in the `vendorVaultStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted VendorVault state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Adafruit …​` to add a new vendor contact. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitVendorVault()`, causing another modified VendorVault state to be saved into the `vendorVaultStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitVendorVault()`, so the VendorVault state will not be saved into the `vendorVaultStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoVendorVault()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous VendorVault state, and restores the VendorVault to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canundoVendorVault()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoVendorVault()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the VendorVault to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `vendorVaultStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest VendorVault state, then there are no undone VendorVault states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoVendorVault()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the VendorVault, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitVendorVault()`, `Model#undoVendorVault()` or `Model#redoVendorVault()`. Thus, the `vendorVaultStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitVendorVault()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `vendorVaultStateList`, all VendorVault states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/Adafruit …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire VendorVault.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and support for future commands.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command and future commands are correct.

Given that VendorVault’s data size is expected to remain relatively small (e.g. around 1,000 contacts and 5,000 products) and undoable actions are typically performed in small batches during regular use by small business owners, so the memory overhead of storing snapshots is acceptable.

**Aspect: Granularity of undo/redo scope:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Single unified VendorVault snapshot per commit.
    * Pros: One consistent state per commit makes it simple to reason about as one undo always undoes exactly one user action regardless of whether it touched contacts, products, or both.
    * Cons: Even if only contacts are modified, the full inventory snapshot is stored too, wasting memory.

* **Alternative 2:** Separate versioned histories for AddressBook and Inventory.
    * Pros: More fine-grained memory usage.
    * Cons: Significantly increases complexity. A single user action that touches both (e.g. clear) would need to commit to both histories atomically, and undo would need to roll back both in sync, increasing the risk of histories becoming desynchronised.

Since VendorVault’s data size is expected to be small and the number of undoable actions per session is unlikely to be large, the additional memory usage from storing full snapshots of both internally is acceptable, to get more consistent undo behaviour.

**Aspect: Where the commit is triggered:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each command calls Model#commitVendorVault() itself.
    * Pros: Gives each command full control, so commands that should not create a snapshot (e.g. list, find) simply don't call commit.
    * Cons: Future command implementors must remember to call commit.

* **Alternative 2:** LogicManager automatically commits after every successful command execution.
    * Pros: Centralises the responsibility in one place.
    * Cons: Read-only commands (e.g. list, find) would create unnecessary snapshots unless they are explicitly excluded, requiring a marker interface or flag on the Command class.

Given that only certain commands should create undoable states, we chose Alternative 1 as it gives each command explicit control over when a snapshot is created. This avoids unnecessary snapshots for read-only commands and keeps the undo history meaningful.

### Command History Feature

#### Implementation
The command history feature is implemented using a `CommandHistory` class that maintains a list of previously executed commands. Each time a command is executed, it is added to the `CommandHistory`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:
* `CommandHistory#add(String commandText)` — Adds a command as a string to the history.
* `CommandHistory#getPrevious(String currentInput)` — Returns the previous command in the history.
* `CommandHistory#getNext(String currentInput)` — Returns the next command in the history.
* `CommandHistory#resetNavigation()` — Resets the navigation pointer to the end of the history.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface through the `Logic#getCommandHistory()` method, which returns the `CommandHistory` object, allowing the UI to access the command history and implement features such as navigating through previous commands using the up/down arrow keys.

#### Usage Scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command history behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the command `add n/Adafruit Industries...`. The command is executed and added to the `CommandHistory`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Commands are added to the `CommandHistory` only if they execute successfully. This includes commands whose execution produces warnings.

</box>

Step 2. The user executes the command `delete support@adafruit.com`. The command is executed and added to the `CommandHistory`.

Step 3. The user presses the UP arrow key to navigate to the previous command. The `CommandHistory#getPrevious()` method is called with the current input (empty in this case). The command box is then updated with the previous command `delete support@adafruit.com`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `getPrevious` operation works as described:
<puml src="diagrams/command-history/SequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Command History Sequence Diagram" />

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

The following activity diagram below summarizes how key presses are handled to navigate through the command history:
<puml src="diagrams/command-history/ActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Command History Activity Diagram" />

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How command history stores input:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain a list of command strings and navigate via an index.
    * Pros: Simple, lightweight and easy to integrate with UI navigation (UP/DOWN keys).
    * Cons: Only stores raw strings, so it cannot preserve command execution context.

* **Alternative 2:** Store command objects with full state.
    * Pros: Could enable richer functionality
    * Cons: More complex, higher memory usage, unnecessary for typical command history navigation.

Since the goal is shell-like navigation, storing only strings is sufficient and keeps the implementation simple.

**Aspect: How navigation handles partially typed input:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Preserve the current input as a “draft” when the user navigates through history.
    * Pros: More UX-friendly, as user can return to unfinished input after scrolling through history.
    * Cons: Slight increase in code complexity to manage a separate draftCommandText.

* **Alternative 2:** Ignore partially typed input and always replace with history.
    * Pros: Simpler, no need for a draft variable.
    * Cons: User loses in-progress typing when navigating, which is frustrating in practice.

Preserving draft input improves user experience and is easy to implement with minimal overhead.

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

### Data Archiving Feature

#### Implementation

The archive feature allows both vendor contacts and products to be hidden from the main lists without permanently deleting them. Archived records remain stored in the system and can be restored at any time.

The feature introduces four commands:
```
archive EMAIL                 — archives a vendor contact
restore [EMAIL]               — restores an archived vendor; lists all archived vendors if no email given
archiveproduct IDENTIFIER     — archives a product
restoreproduct [IDENTIFIER]   — restores an archived product; lists all archived products if no identifier given
```

**Vendor archiving** — `Person` uses a tag-based approach: `isArchived()` checks whether the person's tag set contains an `"archived"` tag. `Person#archive()` returns a new `Person` with the tag added; `Person#restore()` returns a new `Person` with the tag removed.

**Product archiving** — `Product` uses a dedicated `boolean isArchived` field. `Product#archive()` and `Product#restore()` return new instances with the flag toggled accordingly.

Both sets of operations are exposed through the `Model` interface:
```
Model#archivePerson(Person person)
Model#restorePerson(Person person)
Model#archiveProduct(Product product)
Model#restoreProduct(Product product)
```

The `ModelManager` implementations call `addressBook.setPerson()` and `inventory.setProduct()` respectively to swap the old record for the newly created immutable copy.

#### Usage Scenario
##### Vendor Archiving

Given below is an example of the vendor archive/restore lifecycle.

**Step 1.** The vendor list contains two active vendors, Alice and Bob.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveState0.puml" />

**Step 2.** The user executes `archive alice@example.com`. Alice's `Person` object is replaced with a copy that has the `"archived"` tag added. Because the active filtered list excludes archived persons, Alice disappears from the main view.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveState1.puml" />

**Step 3.** The user executes `restore alice@example.com`. Alice's `Person` object is replaced with a copy that has the `"archived"` tag removed. She reappears in the main list.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveState2.puml" />

<br>

<box type="info" seamless>

`archiveproduct` / `restoreproduct` follow the same lifecycle as described above, operating on `Product` objects in the `Inventory` instead of `Person` objects in the `AddressBook`.
</box>


The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component when `archive support@adafruit.com` is executed:

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the archive command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ArchiveCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of the diagram.

</box>

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for `restore support@adafruit.com`:

<puml src="diagrams/RestoreSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the restore command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `RestoreCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of the diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an `archive` operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="ArchiveSequenceDiagram-Model" />

Similarly, how a `restore` operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/RestoreSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="RestoreSequenceDiagram-Model" />

In full, the steps for `archive support@adafruit.com` are:

1. `AddressBookParser` identifies the command word `archive`.
2. `ArchiveCommandParser` parses the email argument.
3. An `ArchiveCommand` object is created.
4. `LogicManager` executes the command.
5. The command searches the **full** `VendorVault` person list (not just the filtered list) for the matching email.
6. `Model#archivePerson()` is called, replacing the `Person` with an archived copy via `Person#archive()`.
7. `Model#commitVendorVault()` is called to save the state for undo/redo.
8. The UI updates automatically because archived vendors are excluded from the active filtered list.

The `restore EMAIL` command follows a similar flow: it searches only the archived subset of persons, calls `Model#restorePerson()`, then commits. If no email is provided (or the email is not found), the filtered list is switched to show only archived vendors as a convenience.

<box type="info" seamless>

`archiveproduct IDENTIFIER` and `restoreproduct IDENTIFIER` mirror this flow against the `Inventory`, using `Model#archiveProduct()` / `Model#restoreProduct()`.
</box>

The model also maintains two constant predicates:

```java
PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_PERSONS  = person  -> !person.isArchived()
PREDICATE_SHOW_ACTIVE_PRODUCTS = product -> !product.isArchived()
```

These are applied by default so that archived records are hidden from the main display. When `restore` (without an argument) or `restoreproduct` (without an identifier or with an unknown identifier) is executed, `updateFilteredPersonList(Person::isArchived)` or `updateFilteredProductList(Product::isArchived)` is called temporarily to surface the archived records as a guide to the user.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Representation of archived vendors (`Person`)**

* **Option 1 (current choice):** Use a special `"archived"` tag in the existing `Tag` set.
    * Pros: No schema change; archived status is persisted through the existing JSON tag serialisation without any additional storage field.
    * Cons: The archived flag is semantically different from user-defined tags; mixing them can be confusing and requires care when displaying or editing tags.

* **Option 2:** Add a dedicated `boolean isArchived` field to `Person` (same approach used by `Product`).
    * Pros: Cleaner semantics; no risk of the user accidentally adding/removing the reserved tag.
    * Cons: Requires a storage migration and changes to `JsonAdaptedPerson`.

Option 1 was chosen for `Person` to minimise changes to the existing architecture. A future refactor may unify both approaches.

**Aspect: Representation of archived products (`Product`)**

* **Option 1 (current choice):** Dedicated `boolean isArchived` field.
    * Pros: Clean separation; the field is explicit in the constructor and persisted via `JsonAdaptedProduct`.
    * Cons: Slightly more verbose constructors.

* **Option 2:** Reuse a tag (same approach as `Person`).
    * Cons: Products do not otherwise use tags, so this would be inconsistent.

Option 1 was chosen as `Product` has no pre-existing tag mechanism to reuse.

### Better Search Feature
#### Implementation
This feature upgrades contact and product search to use partial matching and return results ranked by relevance. It 
is implemented through a match predicate and shared ranking contract:

1. `NameContainsKeywordsScoredPredicate` tests if a contact's name matches any keyword using partial matching. The name is split and processed as tokens.
   * `toScore(String token, String keyword, String fullName)` checks each keyword against each token in the name to determine a score.
   * `computeScore(Person person)` returns the best score among all keyword-token pairs using `SCORE_COMPARATOR`.
   * `createPersonComparator()` returns a comparator that ranks contacts by their score.

2. The same applies for `ProductNameContainsKeywordsScoredPredicate`.

3. `FindRelevance` defines the ranking contract.
   * Keyword-token matches are tiered: `EXACT_TOKEN` > `PREFIX_TOKEN` > `SUBSTRING_TOKEN` > `NO_MATCH`. 
   * `Score(MatchTier tier, int unmatchedChars, String sortKey)` represents how relevant a match is.
   * `SCORE_COMPARATOR` implements score comparison.

This diagram shows the structure and dependency of Better Search classes:

<puml src="diagrams/BetterSearchClass.puml" width="500"/>

This diagram shows an example of scoring state when the given keyword is `"adafruit"`:

<puml src="diagrams/BetterSearchObject.puml" width="1000"/>

#### Usage Scenario
This diagram shows how Better Search fits in the execution pipeline:

<puml src="diagrams/BetterSearchSequence.puml" width="2000"/>

**Step 1.** User executes `find adafruit`.

**Step 2.** `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand`.

**Step 3.** `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` creates a `FindCommandParser` that calls `parse("adafruit")`.

**Step 4.** `FindCommandParser#parse` creates a `FindCommand` with a `NameContainsKeywordsScoredPredicate`.

**Step 5.** `LogicManager` calls `FindCommand#execute` on a `ModelManager`.

**Step 6.** `FindCommand` executes and calls `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList`.

**Step 7.** `FindCommand` then creates a `VendorEmailMatchesContactsPredicate` and calls `ModelManager#updateFilteredProductList`.

**Step 8.** The updates trigger `UI` to refresh both contact and product display.

This diagram summarises the decision flow of `find`:

<puml src="diagrams/BetterSearchActivity.puml" width="400"/>

The usage scenario for `findproduct` is analogous.

#### Design Considerations

<div style="height: 10px;"></div>

**Aspect: Matching strategy**

* **Option 1 (current choice):** Partial matching 
  * Pros: Tolerant of incomplete keywords, hence more user-friendly.
  * Cons: Broader set of results.

* **Option 2:** Exact matching
  * Pros: Simpler design; Stricter set of results.
  * Cons: Low usability as users have to remember exact words.

Option 1 was chosen to ensure discoverability and improve user experience.

**Aspect: Ranking strategy**
TODO

**Aspect: Ranking implementation**
* **Option 1 (current choice):** Shared contract between contact and product entity.
  * Pros: Consistent behavior across commands; Reusable implementation.
  * Cons: Careful abstraction required.

* **Option 2:** Independent logic per entity.
  * Pros: Each entity can customise the logic.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Small business owners who:
* Have many vendors' contacts and inventory to manage
* Are tech-savvy and prefers CLI over GUI

**Value proposition**:

VendorVault helps small business owners seamlessly manage vendor contacts and track inventory in one simple system.
By flagging and sorting low-quantity products, owners instantly know what needs restocking and who to contact, enabling timely action without relying on complex or costly inventory tools.

2. The system should respond to invalid commands and inputs with clear errors and/or appropriate warnings.

Portability:
1. The system shall run on Windows, Mac and Linux as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.

Performance:
1. The system shall respond to any valid command within 2 seconds when the total number of entries does not exceed expected usage limits (1,000 vendors contacts and 5,000 products).

Persistence:
1. The system must save app data locally as JSON and load it when launched.

Documentation:
1. The system should provide a developer guide for future contributors, code accompanied by Javadoc comments and a user guide for users.

Security:
1. The system should store data locally on the user’s device and should not transmit data over any network.

Scalability and Capacity:
1. The system should handle at least 1,000 vendor contacts and 5,000 products (performance beyond these limits is not guaranteed).

Maintainability:
1. The system shall separate Logic, Model, Storage and UI components to support future expansion.
